Very Troll-y Errors and "Gotchas"

    Can't access files in container

**The Problem** (for Windows)

If you're in your railenv-manager container (like after running the rrr command) and you can't access your files that you know should be there (like in the /app/ dir which should have everything in your computer's "web-developement-environment/railenvironment/applications" dir)

You might see some error like this:

    bash: /commands/bash/aliases.sh: No such file or directory

Maybe right after you run `rrr` and enter the railenv-manager container.

Or maybe something like this:

    root@61525d6bc351:/# cd app/drumeo/laravel
    bash: cd: app/drumeo/laravel: No such file or directory

**The Cause**

Caleb sez:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"if ur shit aint getting mounted to docker it might be because your docker drive sharing is not working."

This can be caused by changing your Windows password, among other things.

**The Fix**

1.  open docker shared drives settings (right click docker app icon -> settings -> shared drives)

1.  check applicable drives (or at least just your main drive)
hit "Apply"
1.  enter (your Windows) credentials when prompted
restart docker
1.  Run `rrr` again, choosing option (likely "3") to rebuild
1.  ? ? ?
1.  profit

**Can also happen after Docker update**

In which case you just need to re-specify (and authorize) the shared drivesâ€”as per above.

Emails from Local

*"Send emails from Local Development Environment and with PHPUnit Tests"*
(Jonathan, Dec 19th 2016)

**Problem**

...You're running a test that triggers email sending and getting an error like 

    cURL error 60: SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate

**The Fix**

If you just want to send emails from local while doing manual tests, steps 1 & 2 may be sufficient. You only need to proceed to further steps if you want to enable emails to be sent from PHPUnit tests. Be careful with that though! Please hard-code your email address over so that you don't accidentally send stuff to customers. Do not commit that change or any others that break the world.


1.  In `ExternalApiHelpers\Mandrill@sendMail` hard-code your email address over the one passed in so that you don't accidentally send stuff to customers.

1.  In `ExternalApiHelpers\Mandrill@sendMail`, comment-out the `if not production` clause.
1.  In Testcase, comment out the like setting `Mail::pretend` to `true`.
1.  If still getting the error message mentioned above, see [stackoverflow.com/q/29822686](http://stackoverflow.com/q/29822686).

Once you have it set up, keep it there long-term and comment|uncomment to toggle on|off as needed.

Symlinking Packages
-
    ln -s /foo/source /bar/destination
Dont' forget to include that package's path in the project's PHP settings (PHPStorm, Settings -> Language & Frameworks).
