Repository (Git) Branching Model
=

**[UNDER CONSTRUCTION]**

Ideally do everything on new branches created just for the task at hand.*

Merge these branches to develop

Merge `develop` to `production`.
Merge `develop` to `staging`.

Never merge `staging` to `production`.

`*` Ideally use Git-flow and create feature, bug-fix, etc branches. But for the time-being generic branches are fine.

Maybe use this....?
